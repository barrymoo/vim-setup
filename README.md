Vim Setup
=========

This setup uses `Vundle` to bundle up some nifty plugins. Starting with an 
empty `~/.vim`, you can run the `setup.sh` script which will retrieve/setup
vundle and then retrieve/setup all of the plugins. I wanted to provide
a generic autocomplete setup that is language agnostic with strong usage
of `UltiSnips`. 

Packages I like:
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle),
[Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive),
[EasyMotion](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion),
[SuperTab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab),
[Neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim),
[UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips), and
[CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim).

Check out the `.vimrc` for some useful keybindings. Also, feel free to
fork the repository and suggest new snippets!
